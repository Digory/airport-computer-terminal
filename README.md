# airport-computer-terminal
Text-based program for adding, searching, and displaying aeroplane and flight information.

This project is based upon my solution to the final exercise in week 7 of the University of Helsinki's (free) object-oriented programming course (see https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-7/ ).

The program first outputs a text-based menu for adding information about planes and flights. Then, in the second menu, the user is able to search for specific information.
